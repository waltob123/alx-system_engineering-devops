# Postmortem Project - README

## Overview
This project is focused on creating postmortems for web stack outages or incidents. Postmortems serve as essential documentation to analyze and learn from past issues, ultimately improving system reliability and preventing future occurrences. This README provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and guidelines for creating effective postmortems.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to:

Develop the ability to write comprehensive and insightful postmortems for web stack incidents.
Practice identifying the duration, impact, root cause, and resolution of an outage.
Understand the importance of corrective and preventative measures to improve system reliability.
Project Components
Postmortem Document:

Each project submission should include a postmortem document detailing an outage scenario. The document should adhere to the specified format, including an issue summary, timeline, root cause, resolution, and corrective/preventative measures.

README File:

This README file provides essential information about the project's purpose and requirements.

## Project Guidelines
Follow these guidelines when working on your postmortem project:

### Outage Scenario:

Feel free to invent a fictional outage scenario or draw from real experiences, if applicable. Be creative and provide sufficient detail for a compelling postmortem.
Duration and Impact:

Clearly state the start and end times of the outage, including the timezone.
Describe the impact of the outage on the affected service and users. Include statistics, such as response time degradation and error rate increases.
Root Cause:

Explain in detail what caused the issue. This should be a thorough analysis of the underlying problem or trigger of the outage.
Timeline:

Provide a concise timeline of the incident, including when it was detected, how it was detected, actions taken, any misleading investigation paths, escalation, and resolution.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Elaborate on the root cause of the issue, delving into the technical details.
Explain how the issue was resolved, highlighting the steps taken to restore normal system operation.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Offer insights into how similar incidents can be avoided in the future.
Present a clear list of specific tasks that should be undertaken to address the issue and prevent recurrences.
Project Length
Your postmortem document should be between 400 to 600 words, ensuring that it is concise and straight to the point. Use clear and professional language to communicate the details effectively.

### Submission
Once you've completed your postmortem document, submit it along with this README file for review. Remember that this project is designed to enhance your ability to create informative and actionable postmortems for real-world web stack incidents.

### Feedback
Constructive feedback will be provided to help you improve your postmortem-writing skills. If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to reach out.

Happy writing, and let's keep those web stacks running smoothly!
